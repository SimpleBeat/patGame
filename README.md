# Pat the Corgi

*Corgi dog named Pat loves playing hide and seek! Can you find it in the corridor?*

The game is very simple: there is a corridor on the screen, a cute Corgi dog barks and disappears; now the player has to tap on various items to see if the dog is hiding there. There are lots of objects on the screen to interact with: a washing machine, boxes, doors, baskets... Each has an animation and a sound.

**This game is a prototype** (or MVP), and is not optimised for the production. It has been done over the course of a couple of evenings, and needs refactoring, better architecture, and code optimizations. Please, do not judge harshly!
